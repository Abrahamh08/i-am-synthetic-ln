A chilling sensation passed by #3 as he made his way down the slope of the hill and into a new area.
It was all chrome.
#3's small amount of memory only had him recall the grassy lands of the hills.
He could not see in the distance from that viewpoint due to heavy fog.
However, now, seeing the land of chrome, he could only wonder if this is what the world really was.
Not a grassy land with the might of sparrows, scent of flowers, breezes of fresh air, and the fire of the fox.
But chrome.
Was it all chrome?

#3 shrugged this thought aside.
He had only been alive for what felt like two minutes.
It feels longer in the videogame because of the tasks that must be completed,
but since they are breezed through in this written version,
and the written versions are usually the ones that are canonically correct,
I declare that it only felt like two minutes.

#3 continues walking forward.
It is unknown what lies ahead,
but he feels his only hope of understanding anything is to progress forward.
After a while, though, he feels weak.
Why wouldn't he?
Perpetual motion doesn't exist.
He needs energy.
However, #3 has no face, so even if he found something edible he wouldn't be able to consume it.
This is what he thought.
He thinks this as his world slowly fades away, his thoughts becoming less coherent and less complex.
This confirmed it.
#3 is not a god.
He came from the machine as a mortal.
And here, since his life was short lived,
he could only hope that his existence would not leave a footprint in the world and that he was not bound by any soul.
It would be embarrassing for a simple faceless mechanism to try and pretend to have belonged to something more.
A vain science experiment is being discarded, that's all.
Nothing is gained or lost.
