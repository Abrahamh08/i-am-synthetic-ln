Chapter 1

An abandoned lab exists on top of a hill.
Why? Because it is where a scientist used to live.
He lived in the lab-converted house.
He no longer lives there because he is dead.

The hill connects to another hill with a bridge.
This is just how it is.
The other hill has some obstacles and stuff that are relatively hard to pass through.
This will be relevant later.

Back to the lab.
There is a machine in the back of the lab.
The machine lights up and makes sounds.
This is unusual because the machine has been inactive for several years.
Around 10 years probably.

The machine has a door.
The door opens.
A grown man walks out.
However, this man has no face.
He is also albino.
However, this is a cartoonish realm, so he doesn't look that strange.
He is wearing a blue jacket and purple pants.

If this is your first time reading, then you are born into this realm with this man.
Everything he knows, you know.
He is just confused as you are.

If this is not your first time reading, then you know everything so I suppose you are just reading again to see what you missed or to enjoy the ride again.
Please do not worry the characters with a vibe of dramatic irony.

Anyway, back to the story.
This man we will call #3.
The reason for this will be obvious later.

The man walks out of the lab and sees on a table a tape recorder.
He hits play.

"I am the scientist man I was murdered oh noooo" // todo

#3 leaves the lab and crosses the bridge to the other hill.
He completes all the challenging tasks to make it through.
They are not relevant to the story, these tasks exist for the videogame where you learn how to move around by completing the challenging tasks.
